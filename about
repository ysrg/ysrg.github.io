Hi, I'm Sergey and I am a full-stack web developer primarily focused on Node.js and React. I love coding, reading, running and physics. I like simple-to-read code that is easy to reason about. Personal preferences when writing code are paradigms that enforce and promote composability, like functional programming. As to physics, i think of myself as a proponent of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and often ponder over matters such as the approaching technological singularity or the probability that time is just an illusion we use to measure the entropy of our universe. My biggest strength is the ability to focus. I am the antithesis of multitasking. If you would like to hire me or just say hi, feel free to get in touch with me. Have a good one!
